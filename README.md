## Problem Statement
I read a lot of non fiction. At the end of a book, I like to consolidate all my thoughts alongside the author's arguments and quotes.

It's very hard to come back to a 700 page book after reading it and remember all the author's points and what you thought about them.


## Requirements
So I'd like a system to:
- give chapter by chapter summaries
- help me find key arguments, facts, and quotes

Summaries should be an intelligent synthesis, organized by the topics covered alongside the author's thoughts on each topic.

## Restrictions
The cost of the entire experience -- summaizing, finding quotes, ideally even some back and forth with the llm -- should cost less than $2 per book.

## Pricing
For reference, here is the GPT pricing structure.
